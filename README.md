# javascript-quiz

## Client Requirements
The client wanted a a system that would prompt users with a quiz.
The system needed to iterate through questions and penalize the user if they got a question wrong
The systems scoring is based on how fast they can complete the quiz and the remaining time left is calculated into the score.
The system needed a locally stored highscore, per page call, and a way to log your own scores and clear them if desired.
